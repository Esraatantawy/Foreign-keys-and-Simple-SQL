Question1:
USE COMPANY;
INSERT INTO department (Dnumber,Dname,mgr_ssn, mgr_start_date) VALUES (12, "ConsequatLect","6ab",2021-11-8);

INSERT INTO employee (ssn,fname, lname, bdate, address, gender,
salary, Dno) VALUES ("6ab","esraa","tantawy",2021-11-18,"greentowers","F",45.01,12);
SQL query:
DELETE FROM employee WHERE ssn="6ab";
MySQL said: Documentation
Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`company`.`department`, CONSTRAINT `department_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`mgr_ssn`) REFERENCES `employee` (`ssn`))
 
Question2:
INSERT INTO project (Pnumber, Pname, Plocation, Dno) VALUES (123, "esraa","address",13);

Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`company`.`project`, CONSTRAINT `project_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`Dno`) REFERENCES `department` (`Dnumber`))


Question3:
//The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to not accept NULL values, which means that you cannot insert or update a record without adding a value to this field.

I will insert the first row in employee and department before announcing the foreign key.
